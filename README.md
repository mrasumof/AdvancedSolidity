# Advanced Solidity Homework

The objective of this homework is to develop and deploy 3 smart contracts. Each of them have a different purpose and I will explain each in detail below.

### 1.	Associate Profit Splitter (Source Code: “AssociateProfitSplitter.sol”)
The objective of this smart contract is to split the value deposited in the contract among the three wallets selected during contract deployment time.
How it works:
- At deployment time, we need to provide 3 wallet addresses. In our case I am picking the following 3 addresses from Ganache:

The initial balance for these 3 wallets is 104 ETH. We will use the ending balance to demonstrate that a deposit had been made into the contract and moved to the accounts as the smart contract is programmed for.
